                      If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as `desiredState.manifest.containers[2]`.
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      `spec.containers{name}` (where `name` refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified `spec.containers[2]` (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.
